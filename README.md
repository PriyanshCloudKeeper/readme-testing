**Janus** is a robust, production-ready service that acts as a bridge between the **SCIM 2.0 protocol** and the **Keycloak Admin API**. It exposes a standard, compliant SCIM 2.0 interface, allowing any SCIM-compatible Identity Provider (IdP) or client to manage users and groups in a Keycloak instance seamlessly.

The name **Janus** is inspired by the Roman god of gates, transitions, and doorways, perfectly symbolizing this application's role as a gateway between two distinct systems.

## üåü Features

-   **SCIM 2.0 Compliance**: Implements core SCIM 2.0 resources and operations.
    -   **Users**: Create, Read (Get), Update (PUT/PATCH), and Delete.
    -   **Groups**: Create, Read, Update (PUT/PATCH), and Delete, including member management.
    -   **Discovery**: `ServiceProviderConfig`, `ResourceTypes`, and `Schemas` endpoints are fully implemented.
-   **Secure by Design**: Endpoints are secured with OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Tokens, validated against a Keycloak realm.
-   **Robust & Scalable**: Built with Spring Boot for high performance and easy containerization.
-   **Enterprise-Ready**: Maps standard SCIM attributes and the Enterprise User extension to Keycloak user attributes.
-   **Extensible**: Cleanly structured with mappers and services, making it easy to add custom attribute mappings.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a classic three-tier architecture within a Dockerized environment, orchestrated by Docker Compose and fronted by an NGINX reverse proxy.

1.  **NGINX Reverse Proxy**: Handles incoming traffic, terminates SSL/TLS, and routes requests to the appropriate service based on the domain name. It ensures both Keycloak and the Janus bridge are accessible via standard HTTPS.
2.  **Janus (SCIM Bridge)**: The core Spring Boot application that translates SCIM requests to Keycloak API calls.
3.  **Keycloak**: The Identity and Access Management system, responsible for authentication and storing user/group data.
4.  **MariaDB**: The persistent database backend for Keycloak.

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the complete environment on a fresh server (e.g., an AWS EC2 instance).

### Prerequisites

-   A Linux server (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is recommended).
-   Two registered domain names (e.g., `keycloak.yourdomain.com` and `scim.yourdomain.com`).
-   DNS `A` records for both domains pointing to your server's public IP address.
-   **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
    ```bash
    # Install Docker
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    newgrp docker # Activate group change without needing to log out/in
    
    # Install Docker Compose
    sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose-v2
    ```
-   **NGINX** and **Certbot** installed.
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
    ```

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your server. The project includes the Janus source code and the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/janus-scim-keycloak-bridge.git # Replace with your repo URL
cd janus-scim-keycloak-bridge
